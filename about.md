Puppet Champions is a community enablement program for the most active of our
contributors. It helps amplify their work out to the rest of our amazing
community. Who's a contributor, you might ask? Probably you! Anyone who's
contributed code, content, ideas, or towards a positive community experience is
a Puppet Contributor.

This program provides resources and recognition for contributors who've gone
above and beyond. We know that our world is a busy and crowded space, and we're
honored that you're sharing so much of your time with us. We'd like to help you
and to give you the appropriate kudos for the awesome work you do.

## What Champions offers you:

We're invested in your success, so we're providing you everything we can to
lower friction for Champion members. Some of the tools you'll have at your
fingertips include:

* The monthly *Puppet Champions Inside Scoop* newsletter with lots of exciting
  information about internal projects and upcoming news.
* Access to Puppet community content like presentations, demos, and workshops
  that you'll be able to deliver as your own for local meetups or user groups.
* The ability to contribute back to the Champions Content Library.
* Puppet store discount codes twice a year. You can use them yourself, or share
  with a friend.
* An annual allotment of stickers and other swag for you to give away at events.
* Make your voice heard with Puppet's blog, podcast, and others.

In addition, anyone in the Champions program can apply for Trusted Contributor
access to many of our projects. This will give you limited maintainership rights,
like the ability to merge pull requests and even make module releases on your own.
